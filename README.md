Music Genre Classification
This work used small FMA dataset, and classified only 4 genres namely Electronic, Pop, Folk and Instrument.
Each clip also is sliced into 3 pieces of 10 second to increase numbers of samples.
This project aimed to compare a variety of tagging music genre algorithms including K-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector, Convolution Neural Networks, Convolution Recurrent Neural Networks (CRNN) and Parallel Convolution Recurrent Neural Networks (PCRNN). For CRNN and PCRNN model, I modified some parameters from this repository (https://github.com/priya-dwivedi/Music_Genre_Classification)
